# File System Manager

*Important: Windows Servers are currently not supported!*

The File System Manager extension for Concrete CMS eliminates the need for external FTP access by allowing you to manage your entire hosting file system directly from the dashboard. Whether you want to upload, edit, move, copy, or delete files and directories, all essential file operations are just a click awayâ€”no more switching between FTP clients and your CMS. You can even edit config files live on your server. However, due to the potential risks involved with system file manipulation, it's recommended to use this tool only if you have technical experience and to ensure regular backups are in place. A comprehensive permission system lets you assign specific rights to different users via task permissions in Concrete CMS, providing fine-grained control over who can perform which actions. The intuitive interface is seamlessly integrated into the dashboard, perfectly matching the look and feel of Concrete CMS. Note: Windows servers are currently not supported.
